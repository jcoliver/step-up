# R lesson on data analysis and visualization

This repository holds a single lesson introducing some basic statistics (t-test 
and linear regression) and corresponding data visualizations.

See [https://jcoliver.github.io/step-up/step-up-lesson.html](https://jcoliver.github.io/step-up/step-up-lesson.html).

All data used in the lesson are available in the `data` directory and are
